Projects she's been working on include a Ruby on Sinatra app named [Accountability Checklist](https://github.com/mindplace/accountability-list), a collaboratively-built CRUD Rails app for a fake film festival named [LES Film Festival](https://github.com/jmcolella/les-film-festival), and her own Rosetta Code repo called [multiple-languages](https://github.com/mindplace/multiple_languages).
